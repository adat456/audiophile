# audiophile

This project was created for a Frontend Mentor exercise (https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/audiophile-ecommerce-website-C8cuSd_wx). It is a basic mock e-commerce site that pulls product information from a database for display, allows the user to add/remove items from a localStorage cart, and saves purchase and payment information to that database. In addition, it accomodates most common screen widths.

I chose this challenge because I wanted to further develop my familiarity with Javascript frameworks, creating responsive styles, and writing to and reading from databases. It was built over the course of two weeks with React and Sass on the front-end and Express and Mongoose/MongoDB on the back-end.

Going forward, I would like to implement more thorough error handling, accessible features, and cleaner/more reusable CSS and Sass. I also made an attempt to incorporate Typescript into this project to take advantage of its static typing features, but there were many TypeErrors that I aim to address in future projects.
